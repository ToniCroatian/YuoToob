hi there, here's all you need to know about this:
- you need at least PHP 8.0
- the vendor folder is preloaded
- free to use and distribute idc honestly
- the videos and thumbnails are stored in the data folder located in the root of the src
- it's pretty much boring
- to connect to the db, you need to change the credentials in "SRC_ROOT\needed\config.ini" and "SRC_ROOT\cdn\needed\config.ini"
- idk

known bugs:
- maybe the email confirmation system idk
